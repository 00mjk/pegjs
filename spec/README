PEG.js Spec Suite
=================

This is the PEG.js spec suite. It ensures PEG.js works correctly. All specs
should always pass on all supported platforms.

Running in a browser
--------------------

  1. Start a web server and make it serve the PEG.js root directory (one level
     up from this one).

  2. Point your browser to an URL corresponding to the index.html file.

  3. Watch the specs pass (or fail).

If you have Python installed, you can just run the following command in the
PEG.js root directory

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and load http://localhost:8000/spec/ in your browser.

Running from a command-line
---------------------------

  1. Make sure you have Node.js and the "jasmine-node" npm pacakge installed.

  2. Run the following command:

       jasmine-node --verbose .

  3. Watch the specs pass (or fail).
